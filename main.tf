/**
 * ## Credstash Setup
 *
 * Setup KMS Master Key and a DynamoDB Table for use with Credstash.
 *
 * By default, this module doesn't need any variables to be set manually, but can
 * be overridden if necessary. By doing so it is possible to create either key or
 * database table or both, as well as other customizations.
 *
 * **Resources created here cannot be deleted using terraform and have to be deleted
 * manually. This behavior is to prevent possibility of sensitive data loss.**
